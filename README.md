## Problem 1
- Scenario: Stadium
- Assumptions:
  - explain_your_assumptions
- Assets:
  - The first asset under our protection are the two football teams — both the home team and their opponent — and their associated staff. This primarily includes just their personnel, but is also relevant to their equipment/accessories as these objects are likely to come into close contact with them and have large opportunities to affect them. The second asset under protection is the audience watching the game. The third is the physical stadium (and associated equipment). The fourth is the abstract notion of “the game of football” — since the teams want (arguably, need) to play football, and that’s the purpose for the crowd gathering, a disruption that does not affect the previous three assists but still manages to stop the game is also a threat, though not at the same level since human lives are not at risk.
  - Taking a closer look at the football teams, we can see that we would want to  protect their confidentiality (play calls, game plan, etc) as well as their availability for the game (getting constantly mobbed by fans is not conducive to a football game).
- Threats:
  - The possible threats can be categorized into groups based on the asset delineation above.
  - Threats on the football team (these apply to both teams, but will only be described in the context of the home team): Attackers could include fans of the opposing team who wish to 1) disable the home team by injuring the players, or their necessary equipment 2) steal confidential information regarding the team’s operation to disrupt them at a later time 3) not physically injure them, but still render them unavailable for the game. These attacks would typically be motivated by an allegiance to the opposing team (official or otherwise), and would either be carried out by fans or “says” from the opposing team.
  - Threats on the audience include: 1) Typical violence that may occur between passionate fans of opposing teams 2) attacks that take advantage of the high density of people (a bomb going off in the stands would injure more people in a stadium than in a parking lot) 3) attacks that take advantage of people’s focus on the game (e.g. pickpocketing). These attacks are not specific to a football stadium, but rather to large, public areas — (imagine a public square in a tourist city on a national holiday), and so these attackers motives would have to be based on affecting as many people as possible with their actions.
  - Threats on the stadium are possible, but unlikely to occur in isolation (destruction fo destruction’s sake) — this would likely be a by-product of one of the previous two attacks.
  - Threats on the game of football would likely include be fans interfering with the field, or interfering with the electronics used to run the game. These likely have no motives because attention seeking.
- Countermeasures:
  - The countermeasure that covers the largest number of the threats above is security personnel, coupled with screening the audience for unusual objects. Through the security screening, any weapons of force would be confiscated, leaving most attackers to only their physical bodies. Any threat they pose (trying to injury players, other fans, break the stadium, run onto the field) can easily be stopped early in the act by having an adequate number of appropriately placed security personnel. It should be noted that this does not _prevent_ the most motivated of attackers, but is still able to quickly extinguish the attack. Prevention is largely supplied by the screening, and it would be unreasonable to govern the individual behaviors of a large crowd _that_ closely. While this strategy may require the hiring of many security personnel, that one action covers almost the entire range of possible attacks, and has the added benefit of being able to scale with the attack (more personnel can come to help address a larger issue).
